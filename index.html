                <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for a person of their height. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (kg/m²).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Importance:</strong> BMI is widely used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into weight categories that may lead to health problems. These categories include underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. While not a direct measure of body fat, BMI helps in identifying potential health risks associated with different weight levels.
                </p>

                <h3>What is BMR?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to accomplish its most basic (basal) life-sustaining functions. These functions include breathing, circulation, nutrient processing, and cell production. BMR is measured in a controlled environment with a neutral temperature and while the subject is at rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Importance:</strong> Understanding your BMR can help you better manage your caloric needs. It provides a baseline for determining the amount of food energy (calories) you should consume depending on your activity level to maintain, gain, or lose weight. Knowing your BMR can also be instrumental in creating a personalized diet plan that aligns with your metabolic health and fitness goals.
                </p>

                <h3>What is TDEE?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the total number of calories you burn each day through all activities, including sleeping, eating, exercising, and performing daily routines. TDEE is usually calculated by multiplying the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by an activity factor that represents different levels of physical activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Importance:</strong> Knowing your TDEE is crucial for designing diet and exercise plans, as it provides a comprehensive overview of your daily caloric needs. It helps in creating a balanced diet and exercise regimen that can effectively support weight management, muscle gain, or weight loss based on your personal health and fitness objectives.
